## Business Rules
- Discount rates are allocated based on the customerâ€™s category.
- Multiple products can exist within a single order.
- Each product is linked with one vendor while a vendor can supply multiple products.
- Customers are separated into three tiers: Regular, Staff, and VIP.
- Payment options include cash on delivery, credit/debit cards, e-wallets, and others to offer flexibility to customers.
- The system provides accurate and timely insights into product availability, minimizing stockouts and preventing overselling.

## Entities and Attributes
### Product Table
- **Product Id**: NUMBER(38)
- **Product Name**: VARCHAR2(255)
- **Price**: NUMBER(38)
- **Description**: VARCHAR(255)
- **Stock Quantity**: NUMBER(38)

### Order Table
- **Order ID**: NUMBER(38)
- **Order Date**: DATE
- **Discount Percent**: NUMBER(28)
- **Total Amount**: NUMBER(38)
- **Payment Method**: VARCHAR2(20)

### Customer Table
- **Customer ID**: NUMBER(38)
- **Customer Name**: VARCHAR2(30)
- **Customer Category**: VARCHAR2(255)
- **Address**: VARCHAR2(50)
- **Email**: VARCHAR(255)

### Vendor Table
- **Vendor ID**: NUMBER(38)
- **Vendor Name**: VARCHAR2(255)
- **Phone Number**: NUMBER(38)
- **Email Address**: VARCHAR(255)

## Normalization
### First Normal Form (1NF)
Ensures each attribute holds only atomic values, eliminating repeating groups.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
Eliminates partial dependencies on the primary key, ensuring all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
Removes transitive dependencies, ensuring that all attributes are only dependent on the primary key.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
### Initial ERD
An initial structured model for managing customers, vendors, products, and orders, capturing key relationships and attributes for further data organization and analysis.

### Final ERD
A refined ERD post-normalization to ensure optimized data integrity and organization.

## Implementation
### SQL Queries
The fundamental role of Structured Query Language (SQL) in database management includes creating users, tables, and inserting values into tables.

### Sample Queries
- **Creating User**: `CREATE USER ...`
- **Table Creation**: `CREATE TABLE ...`
- **Inserting Values**: `INSERT INTO ...`

## Database Querying
### Information Queries
- Retrieve specific data such as customer orders, product details, etc.

### Transaction Queries
- Handle complex transactions ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Critical Evaluation
### Module Evaluation
Usage and subject relations critically evaluated to ensure the database meets all business requirements and optimizes operations.

### Performance and Improvements
Discusses potential improvements and performance evaluations based on real-world application.

## Conclusion
A comprehensive database management system is essential for the efficient operation of an e-commerce platform, facilitating seamless customer interactions, product management, and order fulfillment. This project showcases the importance of proper database design, normalization, and SQL implementation in achieving these goals.

## Additional Insights
### Scalability
The database is designed to be scalable, accommodating future growth in terms of customers, products, and transactions.

### Security
Emphasizes the importance of database security measures such as user authentication, data encryption, and secure payment gateways.

### Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements include implementing advanced analytics for better decision-making, integrating AI for personalized customer experiences, and adopting cloud-based solutions for better scalability and performance.
